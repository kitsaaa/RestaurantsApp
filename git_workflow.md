# Git Workflow
1. Create a new branch of main repository called development branch which is used for combining individual works to if they are working together or not.
2. Create a new branch of main repository for yourself and switch your work place to that branch.
3. Before doing any task, make sure to add that task into issue to let other students know which part you are currently work on.
4. Make sure you have the most up to date version of project and did the pull request from development branch.
5. After doing the task, before making a pull request to the development branch, make sure your code doesn't have any error.
6. After making pull request to development branch, check to see if your work has any conflict with other students work that pulled their work into branch at the same time. If it does, ask the student to work on the conflicts together to find a solution for that.
7. After all the steps are done and there's no error on development branch, make the pull request to main branch.
8. During the process, if you reject a pull request, leave a response indicating why you have not accepted them, asking the other contributor to fix the problems.
9. Make sure to Commit any changes, including a meaningful commit message.
