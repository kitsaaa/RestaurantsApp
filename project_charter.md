# Tourguide website

## 1. Introduction

This project aims at creating a website with which people can see information and reviews about different places and restaurants in Toronto. Basically, it is like a guided tour website for anyone who is willing to travel to Toronto and looking for recommendations. We are planning to have the following tools in our website; A tool for creating new posts, a tool for leaving comments under each post, a tool for searching through posts and setting filters for them. Also, each admin should be able to log in to his/her account to access some of the mentioned tools such as creating a new post or delete and edit one.

## 5. Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints

### 5.1 Risks

- Required APIs might start charging, or stop working altogether
- Some of the contracted services can have sudden price hikes
- Any issues with MongoDb and/or Heroku can affect the website accessibility
- Team members might make changes to the website that causes the website to become unaccessible
- Users might find it hard to use this tour guide website instead of checking out the reviews on google

### 5.2 Assumptions

- The Admins are versed in all technologies required to create and maintain the website
- The contracted services for hosting and domain are extremely reliable(accessible for more than 99.9% of the time)
- All team members are committed to the project and will abide to our working agreement
- The required database and API are free to use and provide data that can be used for our project purposes

### 5.3 Constraints

- No personal information will be stored (and/or displayed) in the website besides User names and comments
- The project needs to be completed before the end of the program( April 2024)
- On Heroku we are limited to a rolling window of 75 requests to Heroku Git repos per hour, per app, per user.
- On Heroku the uncompressed size of a checkout of HEAD from the repo cannot exceed 1GB.
- Mongodb uses high memory for data storage.
- Mongodb has a limit for document size (16mb).
