# Tourguide website

## 1. Introduction

This project aims at creating a website with which people can see information and reviews about different places and restaurants in Toronto. Basically, it is like a guided tour website for anyone who is willing to travel to Toronto and looking for recommendations. We are planning to have the following tools in our website; A tool for creating new posts, a tool for leaving comments under each post, a tool for searching through posts and setting filters for them. Also, each admin should be able to log in to his/her account to access some of the mentioned tools such as creating a new post or delete and edit one.
