# Tourguide website

## 1. Introduction

This project aims at creating a website with which people can see information and reviews about different places and restaurants in Toronto. Basically, it is like a guided tour website for anyone who is willing to travel to Toronto and looking for recommendations. We are planning to have the following tools in our website; A tool for creating new posts, a tool for leaving comments under each post, a tool for searching through posts and setting filters for them. Also, each admin should be able to log in to his/her account to access some of the mentioned tools such as creating a new post or delete and edit one.

## 5. Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints

### 5.1 Risks

- Any issues with hosting and domain that can interfere with the website accessibility will be solely the responsibility of the faculty
- Some of the contracted services can have sudden price hikes
- The faculty can inadvertently make changes that will cause the system to become unaccessible/unreliable
- Students might find it har to navigate a new system outside of the ones already offered by the college (Blackboard)

### 5.2 Assumptions

- The faculty is well versed in all technologies required to create and maintain the website
- The contracted services for hosting and domain are extremely reliable (accessible for more than 99.9% of the time)

### 5.3 Constraints

- No personal information will be stored (and/or displayed) in the website besides students names and emails
- No information regarding grades will be stored (and/or displayed) in the website
