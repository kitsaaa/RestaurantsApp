## Task 2 (18.3/20)

### Project Charter

#### Introduction
- Well done! Remove the last sentences dealing with technologies. (7.5/7.5)*2/3

#### Overview
- Welld one! The sentence should hint at regular users being able to provide feedback. (5/7.5)*2/3

### Technical Details
- All equired tech is listed! (15/15)*2/3

## Task 3

### Use Cases
- **Admin Login ( done by Maryam Najibi)** - Main flow should have more steps. What happens after the login is succesful? This should not just be part of the postcondition. 8/10
- **Admin creates new post ( done by Sarvin Raeisi)** - Missing actor. Steps in the main flow should have been broken down: some steps talk about both actions from the admin, as well as the system. 6/10
- Missing case from Nikita -2 marks.

### Milestones (4.5/5)
- There should be a tool for allow admins to create other user accounts

### Deliverables (4.5/5)
- Sorting and searching are used interchangeably, and this is confusing. You either talk exclusively about one, or about the other. Or, even better, about both. You might even want to consider also adding filtering.

## Task 4

### Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints (5/5)
Perfect!

### README.md (5/5)
Group messaging tool removed as requested

### Use Cases
- **Admin deletes Comment (done by Sarvin Raeisi)** - Well done! (8/10) I would expect a delete button to only be enabeld once a comment was selected. This would eliminate the alternate flow. I was also expecting to have an alternate flow where the admin cancel the process midway. -2
- **User Add Comment ( done by Maryam Najibi)** - Perfect (10/10) I am still confused about the fact that regular users cannot login. This use case is a clear example of an advantage of login in. The user would nto even have to enter his/her personal info. Plus, there could be an option for a logged user to delete a comment.
- **User filters his search results ( done by Nikita Korolkov)** Well done (7/10) - The main flow only lists the actions from the user, not the responses from the system. -3
- **User open post ( done by Nikita Korolkov)** (From previous task -2) - (3/10) Missing actor -1. The main flow only lists the actions from the user, not the responses from the system -3. Multiple typos (user click, instad of user clicks) -1
