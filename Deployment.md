# Deployment
Our group has chosen Heroku for deploying our angular app. 
## Prerequisite
Git and Heroku CLI must be installed before the deployment.
## First Step
The first step is creating a Heroku remote. We have used the command "heroku create -a app" to create an empty application on heroku. For making sure that the new remote has been set up, we can use the command "git remote -v".
## Deploying
Finally for deploying our app to Heroku, we used the command "git push heroku master".
