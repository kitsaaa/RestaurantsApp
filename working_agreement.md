# Working Agreement
This working agreement is effective as of September 30, 2022, between group17 members.
## Communication tools
Our group is using discord for our project discussion and GitHub for document sharing. 
## Meetings
Meeting requests will be posted on Discord. If a member isn't available at the suggested meeting time or day, they must send their availability to reschedule the meeting.
## Standards
As a team, we value strong communication: Meaning each member should engage in the conversation thoroughly and respond within 5 hours to any request or chat.
We follow some meeting standards: everyone should participate in meetings on time and be prepared for the discussion (if the meeting's topic has been specified prior to the meeting).
