This working agreement is effective as of September 30, 2022, between group17 members.
Our group is using discord for our project discussion and GitHub for document sharing. Meeting requests will be posted on Discord and other members will have five hours to respond. If a member isn't available at the suggested meeting time or day, they must send their availability to reschedule the meeting.
As a team, we value strong communication: Meaning each member should engage in the conversation thoroughly and respond as early as they can.
We follow some meeting standards: everyone should participate in meetings on time and be prepared for the discussion (if the meeting's topic has been specified prior to the meeting).
