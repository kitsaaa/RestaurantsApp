## Project Description
Our group is planning to work on a website with which people can see information and reviews about different places and restaurants in Toronto. Basically, it is like a guided tour website for anyone who is willing to travel to Toronto and looking for recommendations.
We are planning to have the following tools in our website. A tool for creating new posts, a tool for leaving comments under each post, a tool for searching through posts and setting filters for them. Also each admin should be able to log in to his/her account to access some of the mentioned tools such as creating a new post or delete and edit one.
We are going to use MongoDb to create the database and then create an API based on that. For the front end we're using angular for functionality and bootstrap for css.Finally, for the backend we are planning to use Node.js.
